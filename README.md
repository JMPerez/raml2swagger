# raml2swagger

This is a RAML to [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) converter. Note that it's under heavy development and it's really basic at the moment.

## How to run it

Install npm packages:

`npm install`

Then run the script:

`node app.js <raml_file> <output_file>`
